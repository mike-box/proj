Sample Input for Hyperscan `hsbench` Performance Measurement
============================================================

This package contains sample pattern sets and corpora for performance analysis
of the Hyperscan regular expression matcher using the `hsbench` tool.

More information about Hyperscan can be found at: <http://01.org/hyperscan/>.


Pattern Sets
------------

Three sample pattern sets are in the pcre/ directory.

 - snort_literals: This is a set of 3,316 literal patterns extracted from the
   sample ruleset included with the Snort 3 network intrusion detection system,
   available at <https://github.com/snortadmin/snort3>. Some of these are
   marked with the HS_FLAG_CASELESS flag so that they match case-insensitively,
   and all of them use HS_FLAG_SINGLEMATCH to limit matching to once per scan
   for each pattern.

 - snort_pcres: This is a set of 847 regular expressions that were also
   extracted from the sample ruleset includes with Snort 3, taken from rules
   targeted at HTTP traffic. It is important to note that these are just the
   patterns extracted from the rules' "pcre:" options, and that scanning for
   them in a single pattern set with Hyperscan is not semantically equivalent
   to scanning for these rules within Snort; this is a sample case intended to
   show Hyperscan's capability for matching expressions simultaneously.

 - teakettle_2500: This is a set of 2,500 synthetic pattern generated with a
   script that produces regular expressions of limited complexity; dictionary
   words separated by character class repeats and alternations.

The format for these pattern sets is a text file, with one ID and expression
per line. For example, the first few lines of the teakettle_2500 set are:

    1:/loofas.+stuffer[^\n]*interparty[^\n]*godwit/is
    2:/procurers.*arsons/s
    3:/^authoress[^\r\n]*typewriter[^\r\n]*disservices/is
    4:/praesidiadyeweedisonomic.*reactivating/is
    5:/times/s


Corpora
-------

Two `hsbench` corpora files are included as sample data for scanning, in the
corpora/ directory:

 - gutenberg.db: A collection of English-language texts from the Gutenberg
   project, broken up into 10,240-byte streams of 2,048-byte blocks.

 - alexa200.db: A large traffic sample constructed from a PCAP capture of an
   automated Web browser browsing a subset of the top sites listed on
   Alexa.com. This file contains 130,957 blocks (originally corresponding to
   packets), and only traffic to or from port 80 is included.

These files are SQLite databases designed to allow convenient construction of
corpora for `hsbench` from arbitrary input. Their format is described in the
Hyperscan Developer Reference, and some sample scripts are included with
Hyperscan to construct corpora from common inputs, such as text files and PCAP
traffic samples.


Example Script
--------------

The script `run_bench.sh`, which takes the location of an `hsbench` binary as
an argument, can be used to run a standard set of tests with the input data
described above.
